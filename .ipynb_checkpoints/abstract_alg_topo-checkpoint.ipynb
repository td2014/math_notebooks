    "Elliptic curves have a number of very interesting properties which have brought them a great deal of attention.  One main property is that rational points on the elliptic curve (i.e. x and y are rational) form a \"group.\"  The most general way to discuss elliptic curves is in the space of $\\mathbb{C}^2$, the space of two complex variables.  That is to say that y and x are to be thought of as complex variables.\n",
