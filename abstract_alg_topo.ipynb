    "# Python notebook to walkthrough some abstract algebra and topology.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to discuss and explore some results in abstract algebra and topology, which are useful tools in many domains.  The idea is to work through some of the preliminary material (logic and set theory) to set the stage, with the final goal of being able to converse in the topics of abstract algebra and topology.  For example, to be able to discuss about groups, rings, fields, Galois theory, Elliptic Curves, manifolds, and so on, with some ability to extend the discussion.  Much of the material is derived from online materials such as wikipedia and so forth, with deviations or enhancements taken up as appropriate to aid the discussion.\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to say anything in terms of mathematics, it is necessary to discuss some of the machinery of logic, which is a tool for organizing thought.  Zeroth order logic is based on truth and falsehood of various statements referred to as propositions. It should be stated at the outset that sometimes logic can be \"tricky\" because it involves assumptions about how humans think, and therefore may seem vague or confusing at times.  The effort here will be to attempt to keep the discussion firmly grounded to the extent possible, such that ambiguity can be avoided.  Aspects of philosophy attempt to clarify these boundaries of thought, language, and reasoning (worth visiting).\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect the discussion to mathematics, it is pointed out in the key reference, that mathematical formulas can be thought of as propositions (either true or false), which when connected together in a sequence lead to proofs of a theorem.  The devices that connect these propositions are called connectives.  Furthermore, it is important to think of the patterns of reasoning as being with respect to placeholders.  If a given pattern of reasoning is valid, then it will work for any object that is substituted for the placeholders.\n",

    "Proof:  \n",
    "We begin by assuming (actually declaring) that an arbitrary element $x$ is in $A\\cap B$.  The definition of $A\\cap B$ tells us that $x$ is common to both sets $A$ and $B$.  Therefore we say that $x\\in A$ and $x\\in B$.  From the definition of $B\\cap A$, we know that it contains elements which are common to both $B$ and $A$, that is, consisting of elements $y$ such that $y\\in B$ and $y\\in A$.  Since we know that $x$ is in both $A$ and $B$, it must also be one of the elements $y$, and this completes the first part of the proof.  For the second part, we assume that $x$ is an element of $B\\cap A$, and show this implies that $x$ is an element of $A\\cap B$, which will complete the proof.  From the definition of $B\\cap A$, we know that $x\\in B$ and $x\\in A$.  Now, we have $A\\cap B$ consists of elements $y$ that are both in $A$ and $B$.  Since we know that $x\\in B$ and $x\\in A$, we know that $x$ must be one of the elements $y$, thus completing the proof (Note that since $x$ was assumed to be arbitrary, it is true for all elements $x$.  We also used the axiom for set equality, which says that if two sets are subsets of each other, they are equal.  Also, a slightly subtle point was that we used the fact that the English meaning of \"and\" is symmetric (i.e. order doesn't matter of the items being referenced)- For example the following statements (1) & (2) are equivalent: (1) $x\\in A$ and $x\\in B$, (2) $x\\in B$ and $x\\in A$ ).    \n",

    "Proof:\n",
    "\n",
    "We must show that the above two sets are equal.  This means that every element in the left hand set is in the right hand set and vice versa.  We begin by assuming that an arbitrary element $x$ is in $A\\cup B$.  This tells us that $x$ is in one of the three mutually exclusive sets: $A\\setminus(A\\cap B)$, $B\\setminus(A\\cap B)$, and $A\\cap B$.  Now, if we expand the right hand side, we see that it consists of elements $y$ which are in one of three mutually exclusive sets:  $B\\setminus(B\\cap A)$, $A\\setminus(B\\cap A)$, and $B\\cap A$.  Now, from the earlier proof, we know that $A\\cap B=B\\cap A$, which implies the last group of sets is $B\\setminus(A\\cap B)$, $A\\setminus(A\\cap B)$, and $A\\cap B$. Therefore, we can see that our $x$ must be the same as one of the $y$ in that it is assumed to be in one of the same mutually exclusive sets.  This completes the first part of the proof.  For the second part, we assume that $x$ is an element of $B\\cup A$, and show this implies that $x$ is an element of $A\\cup B$, which will complete the proof.  From the definition of $B\\cup A$, we know that $x$ is in one of the following mutually exclusive sets:  $B\\setminus(B\\cap A)$, $A\\setminus(B\\cap A)$, and $B\\cap A$. The definition of $A\\cup B$ is a set of elements $y$ are in the mutually exclusive sets $A\\setminus(A\\cap B)$, $B\\setminus(A\\cap B)$, and $A\\cap B$.  In particular, we know that since $A\\cap B=B\\cap A$, this last group of sets can be written as $A\\setminus(B\\cap A)$, $B\\setminus(B\\cap A)$, and $B\\cap A$.  Since we know that $x$ must be in one of those sets, it is equal to one of the $y$ and thus contained in $A\\cap B$ which completes the full proof.\n",

    "Proof:  Preceding as above, we begin by assuming that an arbitrary element $x$ is in $(A\\cap B)\\cap C$, which, from the definition tells us that ${\\Big \\{}x:x\\in (A\\cap B){\\text{ and }}x\\in C{\\Big \\}}$.  We further recursively expand the $(A\\cap B)$ term to yield ${\\Big \\{}x:x\\in A{\\text{ and }}x\\in B {\\text{ and }}x\\in C{\\Big \\}}$.  Since the definition of $A\\cap (B\\cap C)$ will yield the same expression, we see that $x$ will be in that set.  This completes the first part of the proof.  For the second part, we assume that $x$ is an arbitrary element in $A\\cap (B\\cap C)$ which, through the definition (and recursive expansion) tells us that ${\\Big \\{}x:x\\in A{\\text{ and }}x\\in B {\\text{ and }}x\\in C{\\Big \\}}$.  The definition for $(A\\cap B)\\cap C$ will expand to the same result, which implies that $x$ is in that set, thus completing the proof.    \n",

    "Proof:  Begin by assuming that $x$ is in $A\\cap (B\\cup C)$, which by definition yields $ {\\Big \\{} x:x\\in A {\\text{ and }}x\\in (B\\cup C) {\\Big \\}}$.  Expanding $(B\\cup C)$, we have $ {\\Big \\{} x:x\\in A {\\text{ and }}(x\\in B {\\text{ or }} x \\in C) {\\Big \\}}$.  We have three mutually exclusive cases to consider:  (1) $x \\in A {\\text{ and }} x \\in B$ or (2) $x \\in A {\\text{ and }} x \\in C$ or (3) $x \\in A {\\text{ and }} x \\in B {\\text{ and }} x \\in C $.  Looking at the right hand side, upon expansion we see that we have $x \\in A {\\text{ and }} x \\in B$ or $x \\in A {\\text{ and }} x \\in C$ or $x \\in A {\\text{ and }} x \\in B {\\text{ and }} x \\in A {\\text{ and }} x \\in C$.  We can see this is equal to the earlier expansion, thus completing the first part of the proof.  Now we assume that $x$ is in $(A\\cap B)\\cup (A\\cap C)$ for the second part of the proof.  From the definition, the means that we have $x \\in A {\\text{ and }} x \\in B$ or $x \\in A {\\text{ and }} x \\in C$ or $x \\in A {\\text{ and }} x \\in B {\\text{ and }} x \\in A {\\text{ and }} x \\in C$.  We showed earlier that this is equal to the expansion of the left hand side, where we have made the following assumptions: (1) The order of statements in a sequence of \"ands\" doesn't matter (you can rearrange them as needed), and (2) $A \\cap A = A$.  This completes the proof.   \n",
